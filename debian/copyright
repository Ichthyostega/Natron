Upstream-Name: natron
Source: https://github.com/NatronGitHub/Natron
        Since upstream does not provide release tarballs, the source has been
        packaged from the tagged git tree. The embedded lib repositories for
        Mac and MINGW builds have been deleted. Moreover, two git-submodules
        are also embedded:
        - libs/OpenFX https://github.com/NatronGitHub/openfx.git
        - libs/SequenceParsing https://github.com/NatronGitHub/SequenceParsing
